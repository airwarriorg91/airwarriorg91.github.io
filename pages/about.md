# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
A senior undergraduate student majoring in aerospace engineering at IIST, I'm focused on bioinspired flight, aerodynamics, and control systems. My research blends natureâ€™s ingenuity with cutting-edge aerospace technologies. Motivated to learn new skills and take on challenges, I have strong expertise in CFD, programming, and aircraft design. Additionally, I excel in leadership, teamwork, and management, driving innovative and collaborative project outcomes.

Special Skill: He can identify IAF jets and aircraft only with the engine sound, takes years of sky gazing to master it :grin:.
