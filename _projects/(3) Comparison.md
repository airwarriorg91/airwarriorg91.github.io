name: Comparison between NEk5000 and Xcompact3D
tools: [NEK5000, Xcompact3D, DNS, CFD]
description: A numerical experiment was conducted for internal comparison to compare NEK5000 and Xcompact3d code in terms of performance and accuracy. The flow over cylinder at Re=40 was choosen as the benchmark case. Along with accuracy, the effect of domain size on the accuracy of simulation was tested.
