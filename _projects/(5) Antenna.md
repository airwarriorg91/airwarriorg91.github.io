name: UHF/VHF Standalone Antenna Mast Retraction Mechanism
tools: [Dynamics, Mechanisms, Design and Analysis, Catia, SolidWorks]
description: A standalone antenna mast retarction mechanism was designed for the SSPACE Labs at IIST. The antenna is frequently (usually twice a week) lowered from its usual standing position for maintainance purposes. Lowering the antenna with bare hands is posing difficulty and risks antenna for damages. Thus, a mechanism was proposed to solve the following issues.
